# Find the BALL

**Find the BALL** is a 2D browser-based mini-game built using the [ZIM.js](https://zimjs.com/) framework.
Players are presented with a group of animated bouncing balls and must find the hidden target ball based on subtle visual cues and interaction. 
The game was designed as a web-based exercise in UI/UX, animation, and game logic.

This project highlights my ability to create polished interactive experiences with JavaScript and creative coding tools.
